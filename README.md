# SmartLibrary
SmartLibrary is small project born with the aim of easily managing the inventory of a small bookshop by automatically correlating the ISBN codes with the associated data. For the moment it only works for some books whose majority are Italian (working on that).

The project requires different configuration levels, the first of which is to create a project with the necessary permissions on your Google account. I recommend this video as a guide to structure everything:

Once everything is structured you can start searching for books via the panel that will open when the main application is launched. For now the code uses the site "https://www.libreriauniversitaria.it/" to obtain the data. The bug I've noticed for the moment is that after a certain number of accesses the site blocks the application and you have to wait a few days before trying again (I'm working on it)
